## üîß Building from Source

Each tool is a separate Rust project:

```bash
cd portfind
cargo build --release
# Binary will be in target/release/portfind
```

Or build all at once:

```bash
for dir in */; do
  cd "$dir"
  cargo build --release
  cd ..
done
```

## üìù Why These Tools?

macOS comes with great tools, but they can be frustrating:
- `lsof -i :3000` is hard to remember
- `df -h` shows too many system volumes
- DNS flushing requires a long command with sudo
- Finding large directories requires complex `du` incantations

These tools solve these frustrations with simple, memorable commands.

## ü§ù Contributing

Contributions welcome! Each tool is independent, so:
1. Pick a tool directory
2. Make your changes
3. Test with `cargo test` and `cargo build --release`
4. Submit a PR

## üìÑ License
